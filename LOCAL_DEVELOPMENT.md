# Local Development Email Configuration

## Current Setup (Recommended)

Your project is now configured with the **best setup for local development**:

### 1. Email Driver: LOG
- **Why**: No external dependencies needed
- **Where**: All emails are saved to `storage/logs/laravel.log`
- **How to view**: Open the log file to see email contents

```bash
# View recent emails
tail -f storage/logs/laravel.log
```

### 2. Auto Email Verification
- **What**: Users are automatically verified in local environment
- **Why**: Speeds up development and testing
- **When**: Only in `APP_ENV=local`

## How It Works

1. When a user registers:
   - Email is "sent" to the log file
   - User is automatically marked as verified
   - User can immediately access all features

2. You can still see what emails would be sent:
   - Check `storage/logs/laravel.log`
   - All email content is preserved

## Testing Email Flow

If you want to test the actual email verification flow:

1. Comment out the auto-verification in `RegisterController.php`:
```php
// if (config('app.env') === 'local') {
//     $user->markEmailAsVerified();
// }
```

2. Register a new user
3. Check the verification link in `storage/logs/laravel.log`
4. Copy and visit the link manually

## Other Options

### Using Mailpit (if you prefer visual UI):
```bash
# Install Mailpit via Docker
docker run -d --name mailpit -p 1025:1025 -p 8025:8025 axllent/mailpit

# Update .env
MAIL_MAILER=smtp
MAIL_HOST=localhost

# View emails at: http://localhost:8025
```

### Using Mailtrap (cloud service):
- Sign up at mailtrap.io
- Get SMTP credentials
- Update .env with their settings
